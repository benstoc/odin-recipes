    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Five ingredients, a few minutes and a hot skillet, and you’ll be digging into a delicious soboro donburi, a gingery ground beef that reminds us that the best Japanese recipes are often the simplest.</p>
    <p>This gingery ground beef stir-fry recipe is Japanese in origin, and often served simply over white rice—that’s how we love to eat it—as a soboro donburi (donburi just means that something is served over steamed rice as a rice bowl). Here in the U.S., Japanese food is often thought of as the height of fussiness—pristine slices of raw fish, carefully placed on perfectly-cooked sushi rice, or quickly seared slices of wagyu that cost a gazillion dollars. But the thing is, Japanese home cooking is actually super approachable, and—here’s the big secret—we like it even better than super-fancy Japanese restaurant food. It’s mostly very, very simple, and at the heart of its simplicity is a deep comfort—in other words, it’s exactly the kind of food we’re hungry for these days. This meaty, savory, gingery ground beef stir-fry comes together in minutes, has just five ingredients, and is a sure-fire family-pleaser.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound 90/10 ground beef</li>
      <li>1/4 cup low sodium soy sauce or tamari</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon minced peeled fresh ginger</li>
      <li>1 cup frozen peas</li>
      <li>cooked rice, for serving (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>In a large skillet over medium-high heat, combine the beef, soy sauce, 1/4 cup water, brown sugar and ginger. Cook, breaking it up with a wooden spoon, until browned, about 8 minutes.</li>
      <li>Stir in the peas, then continue cooking until most of the liquid has evaporated, about 5 more minutes.</li>
      <li>Serve over cooked rice, if using.</li>
    </ol>
